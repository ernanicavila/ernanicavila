I'm the kind of person that like to chat and learn, doesn't matter how difficult it can be, challenges are always good with the proper teaching. 
Giving person, always trying to help and improve as professional.

In my years of experience I became in love with computers, since I had 7~8 years, it became my addiction. Nowdays I try to make my life around Frontend Developing.
